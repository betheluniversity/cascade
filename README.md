cascade
=======

This repository is for bu-cascade, which is a pypi package for python 2/3. We use it to more easily leverage connecting from python to cascade.

The issues document anything in the realm of Cascade or www.bethel.edu as issues. Most of these are outdated, and should be considered to move into Jira, as they do not relate to bu-cascade.
